DESCRIPTION AND REMEDIATION:
============================
The overall goal of this project was to learn about making proper make files for modules as well as
creating your own modules. Another thing that this project helped us learn was how to access data
about processes and how they are typically ordered in an operating system. Some initial issues that
came out of this project was getting the make file to work properly in part 1, as there was some
issues with our VM and the path that was given, but after that issue was resolved the rest of the
parts were able to finished without too much issue.
