**Description of Project:**  <br />
------------------------
2 – 3 Sentences
Here write a few (2-3) sentences describing the purpose of the program. You may be
more specific later in the pseudocode or conclusion section of this report. You should write in
complete sentences to describe the purpose. 

**Pseudocode:**  <br />
----------------------
This can be a picture, drawing, sketch, or digitally produced. For example, if you
hand-wrote it on a sheet of paper, convert it into and image and paste it here. If you typed it
in notepad, copy and paste it here. <br />
A rough draft of how you plan to design your program should be included here. You can
do this in pseudocode or flowchart format. The idea is to begin thinking about how you will
formulate your program and how you will ensure you obtain the results the assignment is
describing.

**Conclusion:**  <br />
--------------------
1-2 Paragraphs
Did the program behave the way you originally intended on the first try? If not, please
identify and describe any challenges encountered, if there were several challenges, select just
the most challenging part of the project. Examples could include coding and logical errors,
difficulties encountered while writing the report, communication between team members, or
other potential problems you now know to avoid not described here. <br />
Describe in which ways the project could have improved? Do you feel as though you
put forth your best efforts? Did your team function well as a group? If not, please share in
which ways with the instructor, not in the conclusion of this report. Students who do not
participate in group projects may submit a single submission that they created by themselves –
it cannot be the same submission the group you are assigned to submitted if you did not
participate in the group work.

**Lessons Learned:** <br />
----------------------
You are not confined to the following prompts, they are examples of the types of
questions you might ponder while determining what your lessons learned were. Each team
member can submit a separate “Lessons Learned” section to the dropbox in Canvas, or each
student can paste a paragraph response in this document. Were you able to complete the
project basically the first time through with little to no errors? Describe how you utilized the
hints (if you needed to)? Describe which part of the project you learned the most from, what
you learned, and how you feel it could benefit you someday in the future. Can you relate it to a
potential career you may choose? How did completing this project contribute to your
knowledge of how computing and OS (in general) behave? You may also add general take-
aways about the assignment itself, if you would like. You may consider addressing: do you feel
the assignment was about the appropriate breadth and depth you would expect from a higher
level CS course?
